# Development checkpoint

Implemented registered commands, effective persisted overrides and generated hints;
owned palette/context/help/capture panels; form/editor/queue commands; actual native
responder routing; owned sidebar/card navigation; view Find. Fixed startup, exact
modifier, native editing/IME, stale selection/context, window/panel lifetime and
cross-window focus/triage defects. Settings persistence errors remain visible.

Files: AppCommandRegistry, CommandKeyboardRouting, CommandPaletteView,
ArchiveSidebarNavigation, ReviewCommandInputView; AppCommands/AppState/Models/UIState;
Content/Archive/Settings/Google/description/review views; two command test files;
APP_RELEASE.env and matching tracking. No new dependency.

Full verification: 491 tests / 2 suites, 25.921 s, 44 new command functions. Native
hidden windows, real NSTextView/NSTextField editor and NSWindow event paths. Distinct
pre-fix logs plus deliberate sheet/IME guard reversal prove the defects are detected.
Final run: `/private/tmp/walkfolio-keyboard-checkpoint-112.log`.

Not shipped. App target is 0.7.16/152 on `codex/walkfolio-command-layer`; installed
0.7.15/151 remains closed. No headed/manual UI, live archive, private delivery or real
provider authorisation. Astra reviewed read-only; reported failures fixed/tested;
remaining UI control inventory and final review are in the matching specification.

Remaining: complete all local and operational command controls with captured targets;
actual menu/help verification; final tests/review; signed bundle, closed install and
exact-version acceptance. Original native/real-copy/provider gates remain open.
